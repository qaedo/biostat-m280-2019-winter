## Q1. Travis CI

1. Read the blog post [_Adding CI To RMarkdown Documents_](http://www.goring.org/resources/Adding_CI_To_RMarkdown.html) by Simon Goring. Understand what is continuous integration (CI) and why we need CI.

2. Set up Travis CI for your homework 2 solution, e.g., `hw2sol.Rmd`. Graders will look for a CI passing badge on the `README.Rmd` page of your repository:

## Q2. FizzBuzz Test

The FizzBuzz test is a common programming interview question used to establish if a candidate can actually program in a language that they claim experience in. The problem statement is as follows:

> "Write a program that given a list of numbers as input, prints each number on their own line. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."

1. Your goal here is to implement FizzBuzz as an R function called `fizzbuzz`. Your fizzbuzz function should conform to the description provided above in terms of output and accept an integer argument, which can either be a scalar or vector. As such, your function should correctly print `Fizz`, `Buzz`, `FizzBuzz`, or the actual number for each integer supplied on a separate line. You should program defensively - validate any input and make sure that you have a sane response to any invalid input.

    You must also include a write up of your implementation that broadly describes how you approached the problem and constructed your solution (think something along the lines of the methods section of a journal article).

    This is not a terribly complex or difficult task, and solutions in R and many other languages are easily Googleable - the point of this exercise is again to get used to the workflow and tools: RStudio, RMarkdown, Git/GitHub, Travis, etc.

2. Use your FizzBuzz function to display the correct output for a variety of inputs, make sure to show what happens for both good and bad input. 

Input must be a vector object otherwise an error message is returned. The function uses a for loop that goes through each object in the input. For each object, if it is not an integer another error message is thrown. In each loop, the function cycles through 4 conditional statements that utilize the modulo operation. The first conditional tests if the item is a multiple of both 3 and 5; if true it tests if the object is 0; if 0 it prints that value and skips the rest of the if statements via next; if it is a multiple of 3 and 5, but is not 0 then "FizzBuzz" is printed and skips the rest of the if statements via next. The next 2 conditionals test for only a multiple of 3 or 5 respectively and prints the proper response if true. The last conditional tests if it is neither a multiple of 3 and 5, and prints the number if true.

```{R}
fizzbuzz <- function(input){
  # if input is not a vector, return error
  if (is.vector(input) == FALSE) stop("Input should be a vector.")
  # for loop to iterate through numbers in vector object
  for (number in input){
    # if number is not an integer, return error
    if (is.integer(number) == FALSE)
      stop("Item in input should be an integer.")
    # test if number is multiple of 3 and 5
    if (number %% 3 == 0 & number %% 5 == 0){
      # if number is equal to 0, print 0 and skip rest of iteration
      if (number == 0){
        print(0)
        next
        # otherwise print FizzBuzz and now skip rest of iteration
      } else {
        print("FizzBuzz")
        next
      }
    }
    # test if number is only multiple of 3
    if (number %% 3 == 0){
      print("Fizz")
    }
    # test if number is only multiple of 5
    if (number %% 5 == 0){
      print("Buzz")
    }
    # test if number is neither multiple of 3 and 5
    if (number %% 5 != 0 & number %% 3 != 0){
      print(number)
    }
  }
}

# create vector of integer numbers
list_1 <- c(3L, 15L, 5L, 9L, 7L, 0L)
fizzbuzz(list_1)
fizzbuzz(3)
```

## Q3. Rcpp

1. Read the online book [_Rcpp For Everyone_](https://teuder.github.io/rcpp4everyone_en/) by Masaki E. Tsuda.

2. Re-do FizzBuzz test using Rcpp. 

```{R}
src <-
"#include <Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;
// [[Rcpp::export]]
void rcpp_fizzbuzz(NumericVector input){
  for (int i = 0; i < input.length(); i++) {
    bool lineprinted = FALSE;
    if (fmod(input[i], 3.0) == 0.0) {  
      Rprintf(\"Fizz\");
      lineprinted = TRUE;
    }
    if (fmod(input[i], 5.0) == 0.0) {
      Rprintf(\"Buzz\");
      lineprinted = TRUE;
    }
    if (lineprinted == TRUE) {
      Rcout << \" \\n\";
    } else {
      Rcout << input[i] << \" \\n\";
    }
  }
}"

sourceCpp(code = src)
nv <- c(3, 5, 15, 11, 11.2)
rcpp_fizzbuzz(nv)
```
